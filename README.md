### Control Cursor IDE via the CLI

Currently this only lets you send Composer commands, either alone or with the @Web command:
- `python3 cursor_debug.py "Write me FizzBuzz"`
- `python3 cursor_debug.py "Write me FizzBuzz"` --web 
 

To install dependencies:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can modify it to run other commands by figuring out the right keyboard event sequence from the Keyboard shortcuts list in Cursor.
